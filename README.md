I am passionate about new technologies. I love programming and messing around with systems, but also traveling and spending time with my family. Immigrant since I was born, I spent my childhood traveling from country to country and thanks to that I have learned to adapt to constant changes. Throughout my career, I have realized that it is important to stay motivated with the project and committed to the team.
